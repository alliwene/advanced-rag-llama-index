Someday, I hope, \\nit will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.\\nSeveral hundred years ago, society didn’t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small \\nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \\nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \\nbecomes ever more important.\\nTraditional software engineering — writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \\nof steps to execute — has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \\nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \\nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This \\ntechnology offers an even better pathway to coding.\\nMany Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman \\nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \\nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \\nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant’s staffing and supply \\nchain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza — my favorite! — so he could make more \\nHawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.\\nUses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data.  Thus, \\na wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived \\ninsights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \\neven more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness \\ndata to make their lives richer.\\nI hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic \\ntraditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code. If society embraces this \\nnew form of literacy as it has the ability to read and write, we will all benefit.Introduction\\n\\nPAGE 5Three Steps to \\nCareer GrowthCHAPTER 1\\n\\nPAGE 6The rapid rise of AI has led to a rapid rise in AI jobs, and many people are building exciting \\ncareers in this field.

In the context of AI, newcomers to the field may experience imposter syndrome, questioning whether they truly belong in the AI community. This can happen regardless of their success in the field. It is important to address imposter syndrome in order to encourage and welcome everyone who wants to join the AI community.\n"
